Classic Chocolate Cake Tips- 

How do you make a cake super moist?

There are several ways to ensure your cake is deliciously moist. First, make sure your ingredients are at room temperature before beginning. Second, avoid overbeating your dry ingredients as you add them to the batter. Lastly, add the milk alternately with the dry ingredients, always beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Keep in mind swapping ingredients, like the whole milk called for, will change the texture and moistness of the cake. Check out more tips like this in our ultimate guide to baking cake.

Which chocolate is best for cake?

Unsweetened cocoa powder is recommended for this cake. It is rich in cocoa butter and dissolves perfectly into the batter to create a nice, smooth texture and strong chocolate flavor. To learn more about each chocolate type, check out this chocolate guide.

How do you know when this cake is finished baking?

You will know your cake is done when either a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Test the cake at the minimum baking time. If the toothpick still has batter or extremely moist crumbs on it, continue baking and test again at the maximum baking time.

Does using salted vs. unsalted butter make a difference?

Unsalted butter is traditionally recommended for baking, as it allows you to control how much salt goes into your baked goods. It also has a light, fresh and smooth flavor that is the perfect template upon which to build your cake. If you do use salted butter, simply adjust the salt in your recipe accordingly, keeping in mind that most butter brands add about ¼ teaspoon salt per ½ cup butter.
